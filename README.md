I've created a comprehensive repository structure for studying electron- and hole-doped high-temperature superconductors! This repository includes:
Key Components:

Structured codebase with classes for doping analysis, phase diagrams, and transport properties
Jupyter notebooks covering different aspects from basic theory to comparative analysis
Data organization for cuprates, iron pnictides, and experimental data
Example code showing how to analyze both hole- and electron-doped systems

Educational Features:

Clear explanations of doping mechanisms in different HTSC families
Interactive phase diagram generation
Comparative analysis tools for different doping types
Real-world examples using materials like YBCO, NCCO, and iron pnictides

Research Tools:

Carrier concentration calculations from Hall effect data
Superconducting dome analysis and optimal doping determination
Quantum critical point identification
Transport and magnetic property analysis
