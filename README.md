 Quick Start
Installation
bashgit clone https://github.com/Zeyad-Mustafa/htsc-doping-analysis.git
cd htsc-doping-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
Basic Usage
pythonfrom htsc_analysis import DopingAnalyzer, HTSCMaterial

# Create analyzer
analyzer = DopingAnalyzer()

# Define material
ybco = HTSCMaterial("YBCO", "cuprate", "hole")

# Add experimental data
ybco.add_data('tc_vs_doping', doping_levels, tc_values, 
              'Hole Doping', 'Tc (K)')

# Find optimal doping
optimal_doping, max_tc = analyzer.find_optimal_doping("YBCO")
print(f"Optimal doping: {optimal_doping:.3f}, Max Tc: {max_tc:.1f} K")
